# Wiki Encyclopedia Project

The Wiki Encyclopedia project is part of a web development initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive platform for managing encyclopedia entries. This project was undertaken as part of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript to showcase skills in web development and user interface design. Below is a summary of the features and requirements implemented in this project:

## Project Summary

The project involves the creation of a user-friendly Wiki Encyclopedia, allowing users to create, view, edit, and search for encyclopedia entries. It provides a seamless experience for users to navigate and contribute to the growing repository of knowledge.

## Requirements

1. **Entry Page:** Users can visit specific entry pages (e.g., `/wiki/TITLE`) to view the contents of individual encyclopedia entries. The title of the page reflects the name of the entry.

2. **Index Page:** The index page (`index.html`) has been enhanced to make each entry name clickable. Users can now navigate directly to the entry page by clicking on the entry name.

3. **Search:** A robust search functionality enables users to type queries into the search box. If a query matches an entry, the user is redirected to that entry's page. Otherwise, a search results page displays entries with the query as a substring.

4. **New Page:** Clicking "Create New Page" allows users to create a new encyclopedia entry. Users can input a title and Markdown content, save the page, and the new entry is added to the collection.

5. **Edit Page:** Each entry page includes a link to edit the entry's Markdown content. Users can make changes, save them, and be redirected back to the entry's page.

6. **Random Page:** Clicking "Random Page" in the sidebar provides users with a serendipitous journey to a randomly selected encyclopedia entry.

7. **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** The `python-markdown2` package is employed to convert Markdown content to HTML, ensuring a readable and polished presentation on each entry's page.
